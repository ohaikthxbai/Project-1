Web Application Name: DinnerView


Problem:
	Trying to decide what movie to watch and where to eat afterwards. 

Target Audience:
	Fun seekers. 

Description		
	The web application will consist of providing the user suggestions on deciding what movie theater to go to, what movies are playing, its times and what's trending restaurants/food/events nearby. It'll utilize a few APIs; providing movie data such as their movie titles, description, reviews, movie times; location data, food location data, reviews, notable dishes, and ratings. The application will provide user the option randomly generate results for each category; display one movie and display a restaurant. If the user doesn't like the combination presented, they can press a button to generate a new suggestion. Once the user decides they agree with the movie + restaurant combination (subject to change) something will happen. Once the application is up and running, additionals may be added (time permitting).
